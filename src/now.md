## Lockdown
Since the coronavirus pandemic is continuing to rage across the United States, I'm living in a state of semi-lockdown this winter and mainly working from home. I'm staving off cabin fever with a few home improvement projects and working on my personal site once more after a dormant period. [Follow along with my redesign posts](/tags/redesign/).



## Learning
In the coming year, I am hoping to revisit each core web technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and learn this medium with more breadth and depth. I am also exploring [certification as an accessibility professional](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification).



## Reading
There are several books on the nightstand to consume this winter. Here's a few titles:

* <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/annals-of-the-former-world/oclc/37588534"><i>Annals of the Former World</i></a> by John&nbsp;McPhee

* <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/mason-and-dixon/oclc/243705730"><i>Mason and Dixon</i></a> by Thomas&nbsp;Pynchon

* <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/regeneration-through-violence-the-mythology-of-the-american-frontier-1600-1860/oclc/333612"><i>Regeneration Through Violence: The Mythology of the American frontier, 1600-1860</i></a> by Richard Slotkin


## Volunteering
I'm serving my final year as a vestry member at [St. James' Episcopal Church](http://stjamesknox.org) in 2021. 

We're continuing to build <strong>people power</strong> with [Justice Knox](http://justiceknox.org) in this organization's fifth year. I'm getting involved with the affordable housing research team and leading a network team again.
