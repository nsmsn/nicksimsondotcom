## Lockdown

Since the coronavirus pandemic is continuing to rage across the United States, Iâ€™m living in a state of semi-lockdown this winter and mainly working from home. Iâ€™m staving off cabin fever with a few home improvement projects and working on my personal site once more after a dormant period. [Follow along with my redesign posts](/tags/redesign/).

## Learning

In the coming year, I am hoping to revisit each core web technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and learn this medium with more breadth and depth. I am also exploring [certification as an accessibility professional](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certification).

## Reading

I am continuing the Nick Simson tradition of reading one printed book ðŸ“– , one ebook ðŸ“±, and one audiobook ðŸŽ§ simultaneously. Here are my current titles:

- <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1029245735"><i>Black reconstruction in America</i></a> by W.E.B.&nbsp;Du&nbsp;Bois ðŸŽ§

- <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/mason-and-dixon/oclc/243705730"><i>Mason and Dixon</i></a> by Thomas&nbsp;Pynchon ðŸ“±

- <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/regeneration-through-violence-the-mythology-of-the-american-frontier-1600-1860/oclc/333612"><i>Regeneration Through Violence: The Mythology of the American frontier, 1600-1860</i></a> by Richard Slotkin ðŸ“–

## Volunteering

Iâ€™m serving my final year as a vestry member at [St. Jamesâ€™ Episcopal Church](http://stjamesknox.org) in 2021.

Weâ€™re continuing to build <strong>people power</strong> with [Justice Knox](http://justiceknox.org) in this organizationâ€™s fifth year. Iâ€™m getting involved with affordable housing research and leading a network team again.
