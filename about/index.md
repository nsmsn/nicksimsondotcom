## Profile

After years of creating things for the fun of it, my formal education in design began in 2004. Seventeen-year-old me discovered a college major that combined photography, drawing, writing, and creating letterforms on cold-press illustration board. That was also the year I bought my first Apple computer.

Today, I am a public sector communication designer at the University of Tennessee. Most of my day is spent designing, building and maintaining websites. I'm mosted interested in getting better at content strategy and accessibility. I'm pretty comfortable working as a bridge between communication teams and IT teams, or between visual designers and engineers.

I occasionally contribute pixels, code, and CMS know-how for small projects, independent artists and other worthy causes. Iâ€™m married to [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com), who makes paintings. We live in Knoxville with Zelda, our dog.

### About this Website
This is my personal website and blog. Like most websites, this one is perpetually under development. You can track its progress at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/nsmsn/nicksimsondotcom). This is built and deployed with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) and Netlify, and I am prioritizing performance and accessibility. For those interested in digging deeper, I'll write a series of posts as I fine tune the design and tech behind the site.
